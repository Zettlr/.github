## About Us

Zettlr is a vibrant community of likeminded people who want to bring serious writing back on track with the technological achievements of the 21st century. The project has been started in 2017 as an attempt to create a Markdown editor that not just enables you to write text in a good way, but also includes many of the nice features that word processors have invented in the past decades.

We are dedicated to continuing the pursuit of an app that is free for everyone to use, helps you to write efficiently, and makes sure that your thoughts get out into the world where they belong!
